      <title>How Elite is the Supreme Court?</title>
      <dc:creator>Justin Burnworth</dc:creator>

      <description>"After struggling most weeks trying to work with my dataset, I realized from our classes that I was looking at my dataset the wrong way. So, I decided to flip the format. I am now looking at just how elite the Supreme Court has been over its history. I do this by grouping Justices to the school they attended. It was such a relief to be able to run the different network commands and actually get graphs or data. I will save working on formating the graphs for the future when my brain recovers.

The new version of my dataset has 104 vertices. It is a directed network. It is not bipartite and there are a total of 76 edges."</description>

      <title>Betweeness Centrality</title>
      <dc:creator>Justin Burnworth</dc:creator>
      <link>https://github.com/DACSS/dacss_course_website/posts/httpsrpubscomburnworthj873118</link>
      <description>"My dataset includes every Supreme Court Justice and the school that their clerks attended. There are 187 vertices which contstitute the Justices and the different universiteis. There are 2487 edges and an edge means there is a connection between a Justice and a school because they have hired a clerk that graduated with their law degree from the university.  
I tried to calculate brokerage, but it says that my data is not proper and I get an error message. I am not sure if that it user error(most likely) or if I am just mixing the steps up.
I was able to calcuate betweeness centrality, but I could not get dplyr to let me slice or arrange the data so I could tell which nodes were the highest. I will work further to make progress on working with the data."</description>

      <description>'My dataset includes every Supreme Court Justice and the school that their clerks attended. There are 187 vertices which contstitute the Justices and the different universiteis. There are 2487 edges and an edge means there is a connection between a Justice and a school because they have hired a clerk that graduated with their law degree from the university.The network density of the dataset is .149 not including loops. When looking at node degreee, you will see that Harvard has the highest count of relationships with 681, Yale is second wiht 464, and Chicago is third with 172.The median node degree is 3 and The mean is 27.33. While the max is 681. The centralziation score for both in and out degrees is 3.65. The nodes with the most outdegree are Harvard, Yale, Chicago, Standford, and Columbia. The nodes with the least outdegree are Penn, Northeastern, Virginia, Temple, Washington &amp; Lee.'</description>

      <description>My dataset includes every Supreme Court Justice and the school that their clerks attended. There are 187 vertices which contstitute the Justices and the different universiteis. There are 2487 edges and an edge means there is a connection between a Justice and a school because they have hired a clerk that graduated with their law degree from the university.

The centralization score for the dataset is .952. The more modern Justices have a higher betweenness score and I believe that is attributed to the fact that the total number of clerks have significantly grown starting back in the 1950s. The schools with the highest scores are Harvard, Georgetown, GW all schools where there have been many clerks hired from. While the schools with a few or only one clerk hired from have much lower scores. 

When it comes to eigenvector centarlity, shows some intersting reults. A modern justice such as Justice Gorsuch has among the highest while Justice Scalia is more middle of the pack. Howver, an older justice, Justice William Howard Taft has just as high of a score as Justice Gorsuch. I am not really sure what these results man. Justice Gorsuch's high score might be explained because he both clerked for a Justice and is a Justice himself.

  The school with the highest bonachi-power is Minnesota with -3.63 whil the lowest is Notre Dame. The Justice with the highest score is interestingly the newest Justice, Amy Coney-Barrett.</description>
